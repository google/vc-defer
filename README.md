# Introduction

This package makes (some) Emacs VC operations fast(er).

The Vc-Defer package aims to make Emacs faster by deferring non-essential work
related to Emacs' built in "VC" mode, with a minimum negative impact.  In
particular, all VC commands should still work normally when invoked explicitly,
even in buffers that Emacs has not yet determined the VC state for.

Usage is simple: require the package, configure the list of problematic backends
(there are no defaults), and enable `vc-defer-mode` (a global mode).  For
example:

    (require 'vc-defer)
    (add-to-list 'vc-defer-backends 'Hg)
    (vc-defer-mode)

...or a similar use-package incantation:

    (use-package vc-defer
      :config
      (add-to-list 'vc-defer-backends 'Hg)
      (vc-defer-mode))

The `vc-defer` customization group used for a similar effect.

Regardless of the configuration approach, when `vc-defer-mode` is on, opening
files no longer enables VC mode for the set of configured backends.  Instead,
the per-file status in those backends are determined on a deferred, as needed,
basis.  The VC status will no longer be displayed in the mode line (at least,
until the first VC command is issued), but basic operations like `find-file'
will be fast.  Emacs will still be slow when VC functionality is actually used,
but at that point the performance issue will make more sense to the user.

 Background

Emacs' built in VC implementation slows Emacs down.  This is most evident when
the VC backend is slow.  The code refreshes information displayed in the mode
line synchronously whenever a file is loaded.  The rest of the VC subsystem is
designed with this assumption; there is no support for deferring this work until
the user explicitly invokes a command actually requires the status.

Evidence that users find this annoying is easy to find.

A thread in r/emacs on Reddit claimed that disabling VC mode was "The biggest
performance improvement to Emacs I've made in years": http://redd.it/4c0mi3, and
it amounts to:

  (remove-hook 'find-file-hooks 'vc-find-file-hook)

This hack, however totally disables VC mode for the affected files.  For
example, later invoking "M-x vc-diff" results in an error.

VC has a supported ways of disabling itself, which are preferable to the above.
Customizing the `vc-ignore-dir-regexp` variable can be used to disable it on a
directory basis, and customizing the `vc-handled-backends` variable can be used
to disable some or all backends entirely.  Neither approach is satisfactory if
the user still wants to use VC commands!

There are other threads.  "Git slows Emacs to Death" at
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6724471/git-slows-down-emacs-to-death-how-to-fix-this
and its companion piece "Mercurial slows Emacs to Death" at
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17323841/mercurial-slows-emacs-to-death-when-opening-saving-files.
In each case, I find it telling that the user(s) did not find it easy to
diagnose and mitigate the performance issues for themselves, which suggests that
Emacs could do better here.  There may be some hope to fix this problem in Emacs
itself.  See
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-02/msg00440.html.

Until then, this little hack can ease the pain.
